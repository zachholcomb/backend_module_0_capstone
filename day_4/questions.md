## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```ruby
def hello(words= "Sam I am")
  p words
end
```
1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```ruby
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

I would write, `hello_someone(Zach)`, this would print `"Zach I am"`.

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

At the moment, I'm just trying to take in the basics of methods; so I don't have any other questions so far.
